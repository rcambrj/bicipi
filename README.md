# tacxble

status: incomplete

Connects to a USB Tacx trainer and exposes it via Bluetooth

## Objectives

* Lightweight and fast:
	* present the device on BLE just like a modern trainer would (no GUI)
* Easy to install:
	* have a downloadable + flashable image for a range of Raspberry Pis
* Support trainers I have access to:
	* Tacx Fortius
* Support popular apps:
	* Zwift, TrainerRoad, MyWhoosh

## FortiusAnt

FortiusAnt by WouterJQ is a comprehensive software package. It connects to a multitude of Tacx trainers, provides a GUI, exposes the device over BLE and ANT+, has support for heart rate monitors, and even has an "exercise bike" mode which uses the trainer's buttons to change resistance... and I'm absolutely certain that there are more features which I've missed.

Installing FortiusAnt along with its (outdated) dependencies is a chore, and with today's variety of client applications, a simpler approach may be all that you need.

That said, if you're looking for a full-featured app, WouterJD is still maintaining FortiusAnt, so you should try it.
